# Lesson 3 - Destructuring Arrays

Destructuring in javascript allows the extraction of elements in arrays and flexible usage of them.

#### Example

```js
let names = ["Fortune", "Iyoha"];

// Destructuring elements
let [firstName, lastName] = names;

console.log(firstName); // Outputs: Fortune
```

> When naming identifiers, always follow best practices and scope new identifiers in the same context as previous identifiers.
