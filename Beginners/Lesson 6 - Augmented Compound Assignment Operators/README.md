# Lesson 6 - Augmented Compound Assignment Operators

A common pattern in programming is assigning a value to a variable with the same identifier. To do that we augment the assignment.
Augmentation is a way of assigning a new value to a variable.

## Augmented Addition

```js
// Declarations
var a = 3;
var b = 17;
var c = 12;
```

### Example 1 (Without Augmentation)

```js
a = a + 12;
b = 9 + b;
c = c + 7;
```

### Example 2 (With Augmentation)

```js
a += 12;
b += 9;
c += 7;
```

## Augmented Subtraction

```js
// Declarations
var a = 43;
var b = 17;
var c = 12;
```

### Example 1 (Without Augmentation)

```js
a = a - 12;
b = 9 - b;
c = c - 7;
```

### Example 2 (With Augmentation)

```js
a -= 12;
b -= 9;
c -= 7;
```

<br>

## Augmented Multiplication

```js
// Declarations
var a = 20;
var b = 15;
var c = 12;
```

### Example 1 (Without Augmentation)

```js
a = a * 5;
b = 3 * b;
c = c * 10;
```

### Example 2 (With Augmentation)

```js
a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;
```

<br>

## Augmented Division

```js
// Declarations
var a = 20;
var b = 15;
var c = 12;
```

### Example 1 (Without Augmentation)

```js
a = a / 5;
b = b / 3;
c = c / 6;
```

### Example 2 (With Augmentation)

```js
a /= 5;
b /= 3;
c /= 6;
```
