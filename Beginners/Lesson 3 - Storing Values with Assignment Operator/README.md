# Lesson 3 - Case Sensitivity in Variables

JavaScript variables are case sensitive i.e variables declared and assigned in **uppercase** and **lowercase** are different.

## Example

```js
// Declarations
var StUdlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var TitleCaseOver;

//Assignments
STUDLYCAPVAR = 10;
PRoperCamelCase = "A String";
tITLEcASEoVER = 9000;
```

Above is an example of case sensitivity in JavaScript.

## Correct Syntax

The correct way to declare variables is with **_camelcase_**.

An identifier with multiple word can be distinguished with the first letter of the first lowercase, the second letter of the second word capital letter, and so on.

## Example

Doing so below is the correct way to work with variables.

```js
// Declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

//Assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
```
