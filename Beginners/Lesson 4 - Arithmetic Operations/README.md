# Lesson 4 - Arithmetic Operations

Arithmetic can be perform in JavaScript with specific symbols.

## Addition

Addition of numbers can be performed using the **"+"** operator.

### Example

```js
var sum = 10 + 2;
console.log(sum);
```

The code above will run and output a result _12_ after evaluation.

## Subtraction

Subtraction of numbers can be performed using the **"-"** operator.

### Example

```js
var difference = 10 - 2;
console.log(difference);
```

The code above will run and output a result _8_ after evaluation.

## Multiplication

Multiplication of numbers can be performed using the **"\*"** operator.

### Example

```js
var product = 10 * 2;
console.log(product);
```

The code above will run and output a result _20_ after evaluation.

## Division

Division of numbers can be performed using the **"\*"** operator.

### Example

```js
var quotient = 10 / 2;
console.log(quotient);
```

The code above will run and output a result _5_ after evaluation.
