# Lesson 5 - Adjusting Numbers Naturally

## Incrementing Numbers

To increment a number means to add 1 to it.

### Example

```js
var elapsedTime = 20;

// Method 1
elapsedTime = elapsedTime + 1;

// Method 2
elapsedTime++;
```

## Decrementing Numbers

To decrement a number means to subtract 1 from it.

### Example

```js
var remainingTime = 20;

// Method 1
remainingTime = remainingTime - 1;

// Method 2
remainingTime--;
```
