# Lesson 9 - IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)

IIFE is a function that executes where it is defined. To achieve this we use a special operator called the group operator `()` and to execute it `(function goes here)()`.

#### Example

```js
(function () {
  console.log("IIFE");
})(); // Outputs: IIFE
```
